        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Turn a one-egg omelette into a wrap and slather on some salsa for a low-carb alternative to a flatbread or sandwich. A quick and easy vegetarian snack</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>a little rapeseed or olive oil for frying</li>
            <li>2 tbsp tomato salsa</li>
            <li>about 1 tbsp fresh coriander</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Beat the egg with 1 tbsp water. Heat the oil in a medium non-stick pan. Add the egg and swirl round the base of the pan, as though you are making a pancake, and cook until set. There is no need to turn it.</li>
            <li>Carefully tip the pancake onto a board, spread with the salsa, sprinkle with the coriander, then roll it up. It can be eaten warm or cold - you can keep it for 2 days in the fridge.</li>

        </ol>
